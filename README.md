So you now I'm paranoid. Well done!<br>
Quest: understand the rules of hide and seek. Apparently this is how programming works.<br><br>
Finished with my woman<br>
'cause she couldn't help me with my mind<br>
People think I'm insane<br>
Because I am frowning all the time<br><br>

All day long I think of things<br>
But nothing seems to satisfy<br>
Think I'll lose my mind<br>
If I don't find something to pacify<br><br>

Can you help me, occupy my brain?<br>
Oh yeah!
<br>
